**Bank Marketing - Decision Tree Classifier**

The objective of this project was to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product/service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I followed a structured machine learning workflow.

**Key Steps**:
- Data Preprocessing: Handled categorical variables using label encoding and checked for missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained insights into customer behavior.
- Model Building: Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Tree Visualization: Plotted the decision tree to understand key decision paths.

**Tools & Skills Applied**:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
- Decision Tree Visualization

**What I Learned**:
This task improved my understanding of classification models and helped me visualize how decisions are made within a model â€” a skill that's crucial for real-world business predictions.
