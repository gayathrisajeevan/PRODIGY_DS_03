The objective of this project was to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product/service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I followed a structured approach:

**Key Steps**:
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing (handling categorical features, missing values)
- Explored data insights via EDA
- Built and evaluated a Decision Tree Classifier using sklearn
- Visualized the decision tree structure to interpret key decision rules

**Tools & Skills Applied**:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Supervised Machine Learning
- Classification Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

This task improved my understanding of classification models and helped me visualize how decisions are made in a model â€” crucial in real-world business predictions!
